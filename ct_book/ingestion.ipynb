The first intuition is that, looking at each column of data separately, there will be more patterns and thus more opportunities to compress the data. The second intuition is that, in data-intensive application, reading the data is the bottleneck. It is then faster to read smaller compressed data in memory and then decompress it (losing a bit of time in compute), rather than reading larger, uncompressed data. Modern compression algorithms such as ZStandard or LZ4 are designed to be very effective at using a processor. Using them is essentially a pure gain in terms of processing speed.\n",
