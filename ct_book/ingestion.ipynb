    "The original data from Climate TRACE is offered as a series of CSV files bundled in ZIP archives. That format is universally understood, but it is not the most effective for effective analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we are going to use the Parquet format. This format has a number of advantages:\n",
    "- it is _column-based_ : data systems can process big chunks of data at once, rather than line by line. Also, depending on the information requested, systems will read only the relevant columns and skip the rest very effectively\n",
    "- it is _structured_ : basic information about numbers, categories, ... are preserved. This provides a large speed boost\n",
    "- it is _universal_ : most modern data systems will be able to read it\n",
